a specialized suit of image processing programs, primarily aimed at obtaining
the 3D reconstruction of biological specimens from large sets of projection
images acquired by transmission electron microscopy. This public-domain
software package was introduced to the electron microscopy field eight years
ago, and since then it has changed drastically. New methodologies for the
analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to
classification, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D
reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has
been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data.
Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of
well-documented data structures and functions, offers a convenient environment
for the development of novel algorithms. In this paper, we present a general
overview of a new generation of Xmipp that has been re-engineered to maximize
flexibility and modularity, potentially facilitating its integration in future
standardization efforts in the field. Moreover, by focusing on those
developments that distinguish Xmipp from other packages available, we
illustrate its added value to the electron microscopy community."
