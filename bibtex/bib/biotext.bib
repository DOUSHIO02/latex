    abstract  = { Background: Experimental techniques such as DNA microarray,
serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry proteomics,
among others, are generating large amounts of data related to genes and
proteins at different levels. As in any other experimental approach, it is
necessary to analyze these data in the context of previously known information
about the biological entities under study. The literature is a particularly
valuable source of information for experiment validation and interpretation.
Therefore, the development of automated text mining tools to assist in such
interpretation is one of the main challenges in current bioinformatics
research.  

Results: We present a method to create literature profiles for large sets of
genes or proteins based on common semantic features extracted from a corpus of
relevant documents. These profiles can be used to establish pair-wise
similarities among genes, utilized in gene/protein classification or can be
even combined with experimental measurements. Semantic features can be used by
researchers to facilitate the understanding of the commonalities indicated by
experimental results. Our approach is based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF), a machine-learning algorithm for data analysis, capable of
identifying local patterns that characterize a subset of the data. The
literature is thus used to establish putative relationships among subsets of
genes or proteins and to provide coherent justification for this clustering
into subsets. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to two
independent and vastly different sets of genes.  

Conclusion: The presented method can create literature profiles from documents
relevant to sets of genes.  The representation of genes as additive linear
combinations of semantic features allows for the exploration of functional
associations as well as for clustering, suggesting a valuable methodology for
the validation and interpretation of high-throughput experimental data.  }

Background
    
    The rapidly expanding fields of genomics and proteomics have prompted the
development of computational methods for managing, analyzing and visualizing
expression data derived from microarray screening. Nevertheless, the lack of
efficient techniques for assessing the biological implications of
gene-expression data remains an important obstacle in exploiting this
information.  

Results
    
    To address this need, we have developed a mining technique based on the
analysis of literature profiles generated by extracting the frequencies of
certain terms from thousands of abstracts stored in the Medline literature
database. Terms are then filtered on the basis of both repetitive occurrence
and co-occurrence among multiple gene entries. Finally, clustering analysis is
performed on the retained frequency values, shaping a coherent picture of the
functional relationship among large and heterogeneous lists of genes. Such data
treatment also provides information on the nature and pertinence of the
associations that were formed.  

Conclusions
    
    The analysis of patterns of term occurrence in abstracts constitutes a
means of exploring the biological significance of large and heterogeneous lists
of genes. This approach should contribute to optimizing the exploitation of
microarray technologies by providing investigators with an interface between
complex expression data and large literature resources.  }

are positioned and the distances between concepts indicates their relatedness.
The ACS uses co-occurrence of concepts as a source of information. In this
paper we evaluate how well the system can retrieve functionally related genes
and we compare its performance with a simple gene co-occurrence method.
    
    Results: To assess the performance of the ACS we composed a test set of
five groups of functionally related genes. With the ACS good scores were
obtained for four of the five groups. When compared to the gene co-occurrence
method, the ACS is capable of revealing more functional biological relations
and can achieve results with less literature available per gene. Hierarchical
clustering was performed on the ACS output, as a potential aid to users, and
was found to provide useful clusters. Our results suggest that the algorithm
can be of value for researchers studying large numbers of genes.}

a strategy, implemented in a system called GEISHA (gene expression information

associated to different gene expression clusters by mining collections of
Medline abstracts. GEISHA is based on a comparison of the frequency of
abstracts linked to different gene clusters and containing a given term.
Interpretation by the end user of the biological meaning of the terms is
facilitated by embedding them in the corresponding significant sentences and
abstracts and by establishing relations with other, equally significant terms.
The information provided by GEISHA for the available yeast expression data
compares favorably with the functional annotations provided by human experts,
demonstrating the potential value of GEISHA as an assistant for the analysis of

published literature. We present a method, neighbor divergence, for assessing
whether the genes within a group share a common biological function based on

language processing techniques to interpret biological text. It requires only a
corpus of documents relevant to the genes being studied (e.g., all genes in an

group of genes, neighbor divergence assigns a numerical score indicating how
``functionally coherent'' the gene group is from the perspective of the
published literature. We evaluate our method by testing its ability to
distinguish 19 known functional gene groups from 1900 randomly assembled
groups. Neighbor divergence achieves 79% sensitivity at 100% specificity,
comparing favorably to other tested methods. We also apply neighbor divergence

Finally, we demonstrate here that pairwise distances derived from the vector
angles of gene abstract documents can be effectively used to functionally group
genes by hierarchical clustering. Our results provide proof-of-principle that
LSI is a robust automated method to elucidate both known (explicit) and unknown

use of n-grams (or some variant of them) in the context of specific learning
algorithms, and thus have not obtained general answers on their usefulness for
TC. In this work we investigate the usefulness of n-grams in TC independently
of any specific learning algorithm. We do so by applying feature selection to
the pool of all k-grams (k <= n), and checking how many n-grams score high
enough to be selected in the top a k-grams. We report the results of our
experiments, using various feature selec- tion measures and varying values of
a, performed on the Reuters-21578 standard TC benchmark. We also report
results of making actual use of the selected n-grams in the context of a linear
classifier induced by means of the Rocchio method.  }

                        Background
      
      Biomedical researchers often want to explore pathogenesis and pathways
regulated by abnormally expressed genes, such as those identified by microarray
analyses. Literature mining is an important way to assist in this task. Many
literature mining tools are now available. However, few of them allows the user
to make manual adjustments to zero in on what he/she wants to know in
particular.  

                        Results
      
      We present our software program, GenCLiP (Gene Cluster with Literature
Profiles), which is based on the methods presented by Chaussabel and Sher
(Genome Biol 2002, 3(10):RESEARCH0055) that search gene lists to identify
functional clusters of genes based on up-to-date literature profiling. Four
features were added to this previously described method: the ability to 1)
manually curate keywords extracted from the literature, 2) search genes and
gene co-occurrence networks related to custom keywords, 3) compare analyzed
gene results with negative and positive controls generated by GenCLiP, and 4)
calculate probabilities that the resulting genes and gene networks are randomly
related. In this paper, we show with a set of differentially expressed genes
between keloids and normal control, how implementation of functions in GenCLiP
successfully identified keywords related to the pathogenesis of keloids and
unknown gene pathways involved in the pathogenesis of keloids.  
                         
                         Conclusion
      
      With regard to the identification of disease-susceptibility genes,
GenCLiP allows one to quickly acquire a primary pathogenesis profile and
identify pathways involving abnormally expressed genes not previously
associated with the disease.}
