9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the
genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals.
Two assembly strategies--a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome
assembly--were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly
funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to
create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced,
without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by
the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the
assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final
assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent
mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the
human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of
100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or
larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional
~12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak
supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the
genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently
noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is
in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of
segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative
genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with
neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the
hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus
sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes
differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked
heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of
all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which
SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.}

has been recently proposed to help with the biological interpretation of such

analysis of high throughput experiments and a large number of tools have been
developed for this purpose. We present a detailed comparison of 14 such tools
using the following criteria: scope of the analysis, visualization
capabilities, statistical model(s) used, correction for multiple comparisons,
reference microarrays available, installation issues and sources of annotation
data. This detailed analysis of the capabilities of these tools will help
researchers choose the most appropriate tool for a given type of analysis. More
importantly, in spite of the fact that this type of analysis has been generally
adopted, this approach has several important intrinsic drawbacks. These
drawbacks are associated with all tools discussed and represent conceptual
limitations of the current state-of-the-art in ontological analysis. We propose
these as challenges for the next generation of secondary data analysis tools.  }

      abstract  = {Background 
          
          High-throughput experiments, such as with DNA
microarrays, typically result in hundreds of genes potentially relevant to the
process under study, rendering the interpretation of these experiments
problematic. Here, we propose and evaluate an approach to find functional
associations between large numbers of genes and other biomedical concepts from
free-text literature. For each gene, a profile of related concepts is
constructed that summarizes the context in which the gene is mentioned in
literature. We assign a weight to each concept in the profile based on a
likelihood ratio measure. Gene concept profiles can then be clustered to find
related genes and other concepts.
      
      Results 
      
      The experimental validation was done in two steps. We first
applied our method on a controlled test set. After this proved to be successful
the datasets from two DNA microarray experiments were analyzed in the same way
and the results were evaluated by domain experts. The first dataset was a
gene-expression profile that characterizes the cancer cells of a group of acute
myeloid leukemia patients. For this group of patients the biological background
of the cancer cells is largely unknown. Using our methodology we found an
association of these cells to monocytes, which agreed with other experimental
evidence. The second data set consisted of differentially expressed genes
following androgen receptor stimulation in a prostate cancer cell line. Based
on the analysis we put forward a hypothesis about the biological processes
induced in these studied cells: secretory lysosomes are involved in the
production of prostatic fluid and their development and/or secretion are
androgen-regulated processes.
      
      Conclusion

      Our method can be used to analyze DNA microarray datasets
based on information explicitly and implicitly available in the literature. We
provide a publicly available tool, dubbed Anni, for this purpose.}

This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results. },

Biol. Cell 19, 1113-1124 ) we have demonstrated the co-participation of the high osmotic response (HOG) pathway to ensure yeast survival to cell wall stress mediated by zymolyase, which hydrolyzes the beta-1,3 glucan network. Here we have characterized the role of both pathways in the regulation of the overall yeast transcriptional responses to zymolyase treatment using whole genome expression profiling. A main group of yeast genes is dependent on both MAPKs, Slt2 and Hog1, for their induction. The transcriptional activation of these genes depends on the MAPKKK Bck1, the transcription factor Rlm1, and elements of the sho1 branch of the HOG pathway, but not on the sensors of the CWI pathway. A second group of genes is dependent on Slt2 but not Hog1 or Pbs2. However, the induction of these genes is dependent on upstream elements of the HOG pathway such as Sho1, Ste50, and Ste11, in accordance with a sequential activation of the HOG and CWI pathways. Zymolyase also promotes an osmotic-like transcriptional response with the activation of a group of genes dependent on elements of the Sho1 branch of HOG pathway but not on Slt2, with the induction of many of them dependent on Msn2/4. Additionally, in the absence of Hog1, zymolyase induces an alternative response related to mating and filamentation as a consequence of the cross-talk between these pathways and the HOG pathway. Finally, in the absence of Slt2, zymolyase increases the induction of genes associated with osmotic adaptation with respect to the wild type, suggesting an inhibitory effect of the CWI pathway over the HOG pathway. These studies clearly reveal the complexity of the signal transduction machinery responsible for regulating yeast adaptation responses to cell wall stress. },

      abstract = { Genome-wide transcript profiling was used to monitor signal transduction during yeast pheromone response. Genetic manipulations allowed analysis of changes in gene expression underlying pheromone signaling, cell cycle control, and polarized morphogenesis. A two-dimensional hierarchical clustered matrix, covering 383 of the most highly regulated genes, was constructed from 46 diverse experimental conditions. Diagnostic subsets of coexpressed genes reflected signaling activity, cross talk, and overlap of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Analysis of the profiles specified by two different MAPKs-Fus3p and Kss1p-revealed functional overlap of the filamentous growth and mating responses. Global transcript analysis reflects biological responses associated with the activation and perturbation of signal transduction pathways. },
