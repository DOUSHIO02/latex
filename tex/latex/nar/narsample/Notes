This is a complete sample directory containing a paper published in
Nucleic Acids Research.

The all.bib file normally is a link to a larger bibliography
file.  I made a sub-bibliography with mksubbib and subbib.bst:

ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/mksubbib
ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/subbib.bst

The script l was used to run everything:

ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/l
