      abstract = {Genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of
the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all
eukaryotes. Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one
organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene
Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be
applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells
is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies
accessible on the World-Wide Web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being
constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.}

      abstract = { The Unified Medical Language System (http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov) is a repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine. The UMLS integrates over 2 million names for some 900,000 concepts from more than 60 families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these concepts. Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. UMLS concepts are not only inter-related, but may also be linked to external resources such as GenBank. In addition to data, the UMLS includes tools for customizing the Metathesaurus (MetamorphoSys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for extracting UMLS concepts from text (MetaMap). The UMLS knowledge sources are updated quarterly. All vocabularies are available at no fee for research purposes within an institution, but UMLS users are required to sign a license agreement. The UMLS knowledge sources are distributed on CD-ROM and by FTP. },
